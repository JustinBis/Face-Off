# Face Off!
## A final project for Brown's CS132

## Setup

Note: instead of setting this all up, you can use our deployed web instance of Face Off at https://face-off-cs132.herokuapp.com

In order to get Face Off running locally, you'll first need to install Meteor. You can do this simply by running the following command in a terminal (or by following the instructions at https://www.meteor.com/install)

`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

Next, from the Face Off root directory, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

Finally, simply run `meteor` to start up a local server on `localhost:3000`

Note that there will be no data in the database, so you'll have to take your own photos to fill it up!
